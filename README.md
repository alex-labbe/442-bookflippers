# # 3D Printing Curriculum for Beginners

## Project Justification
We chose to create a 3D printing curriculum for beginners because it aligns with our collective interest for technology and learning, while still creating a meaningful deliverable. Initially, we reflected on how in the Informatics major, projects typically consist of designing apps or websites to address social justice issues. However, we wanted to explore a different skill that is not taught within the program: CAD and 3D printing.  Each team member self-taught themselves a different tool and crafted a curriculum that allows others to follow the same learning process. The curriculum starts with **TinkerCad**, then **Onshape**, and finally **AutoDesk Fusion 360** to progressively teach more advanced tools. We also chose to include an accessibility lesson to reflect our commitment to making inclusive design-decisions. Ultimately, this project combines our love for learning new skills and tools with our desire to empower others to learn as well!üôÇ ‚ô•Ô∏è

## Completion Criteria
We will use two metrics to judge project completion: **deliverables** (concrete) and **knowledge gained** (subjective).

### Deliverables
- **Draft of Curriculum for learners**
  - Having lessons written out for three modules covering lessons on three different modelling software programs. Within the lessons there will also be pictures, examples, and interactive diagrams  (all of which requires us to create and try the lessons) to facilitate understanding of users and act as a documentation of our own learning process.
- **Physical Printed Objects**
  - Each person will use their preferred program to model and print the model of a puzzle
- **3D Printing Protocol**
  - A written instruction sheet on how to print a basic model for beginners

### Knowledge Gained
- We will also assess project completion by how satisfied we are with our individual learning. The primary objective of the project was to learn more about 3D printing, and how each of us measure that depends on more specifically what we wanted to achieve from the project. However, as long as we all feel that we have gained knowledge and a new skill set and feel comfortable replicating our deliverables from scratch if we were to do it again, we will consider our project complete.
